        <strong>What is Data Structure?</strong> 
        <p> 
            A data structure is defined as a particular 
            way of storing and organizing data in our 
            devices to use the data efficiently and 
            effectively. The main idea behind using 
            data structures is to minimize the time 
            and space complexities. An efficient data 
            structure takes minimum memory space and 
            requires minimum time to execute the data. 
        </p> 
  
        <strong>What is Algorithm?</strong> 
        <p> 
            Algorithm is defined as a process or set 
            of well-defined instructions that are 
            typically used to solve a particular group 
            of problems or perform a specific type of 
            calculation. To explain in simpler terms, 
            it is a set of operations performed in a 
            step-by-step manner to execute a task. 
        </p> 
  
        <strong>How to start learning DSA?</strong> 
        <p> 
            The first and foremost thing is dividing 
            the total procedure into little pieces 
            which need to be done sequentially. The 
            complete process to learn DSA from 
            scratch can be broken into 4 parts: 
        </p> 
  
        <li>Learn about Time and Space complexities</li> 
        <li> 
            Learn the basics of individual 
            Data Structures 
        </li> 
        <li>Learn the basics of Algorithms</li> 
        <li>Practice Problems on DSA</li> 
  
        <strong> 1. Learn about Complexities</strong> 
        <p> 
            Here comes one of the interesting and 
            important topics. The primary motive to 
            use DSA is to solve a problem effectively 
            and efficiently. How can you decide if a 
            program written by you is efficient or 
            not? This is measured by complexities. 
            Complexity is of two types: 
        </p> 
  
        <li> 
            <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Time 
            complexity is used to measure the amount 
            of time required to execute the code. 
        </li> 
        <li> 
            <strong>Space Complexity:</strong> 
            Space complexity means the amount of 
            space required to execute successfully 
            the functionalities of the code. You 
            will also come across the term Auxiliary 
            Space very commonly in DSA, which refers 
            to the extra space used in the program 
            other than the input data structure. 
        </li> 
        <p> 
            Both of the above complexities are 
            measured with respect to the input 
            parameters. But here arises a problem. 
            The time required for executing a code 
            depends on several factors, such as: 
        </p> 
        <li> 
            The number of operations performed 
            in the program 
        </li> 
        <li>The speed of the device, and also</li> 
        <li> 
            The speed of data transfer if being 
            executed on an online platform. 
        </li>
